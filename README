                   git-utils - Various git related utilities

Git Utils is a collection of simple utilities that made my Git life easier
in some way or another. I tried to clean them up as much as necessary prior
to putting here, so it should be easy to use for others as well.


Installation

You don't need anything special, just a working installation of Git and a
UNIX system (tested with Mac OS X and Linux). To install the git-utils into
/usr/local run

	$ sudo make install

or just pick the scripts that you need and place them wherever you want.
